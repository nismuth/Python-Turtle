Python turtle isn't the MOST important python tool to know, but as a beginner it is pretty useful to vizualize concepts.

Some examples:
a) for loops --> some design facets that repeat commands/functions can be organized
b) functions --> shapes/designs symbolize commands and how they affect code
c) ordering --> elements placed in main() overlap previous shapes/lines
d) math --> simple math, sines/cosines, geometry, etc. are visualized

Some interesting applications:
- games (like snake or pong)
- animations (frame by frame)
- physics simulation (projectile motion)
